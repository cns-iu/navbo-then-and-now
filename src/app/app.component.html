    # Co-Author Network

    The co-author network was created from a list of publications.
    Each author is shown as either a circle or a triangle based on whether
    they had an affiliation with one of the selected organizations during
    the time period selected. The size of the author's symbol is based on
    the number of publications they had during that time period. The color
    is based on the number of co-authors they had during that time period.
    Their symbol is labeled if they are one of the selected authors to highlight.
    Each line represents a co-author relationship where they have
    published at least one paper together during the selected time period. The
    thickness of the line is based on the number of publications they authored
    together during the selected time period.

    # Science Map

    The UCSD map of science and classification system was computed using
    paper-level data from about 25,000 journals from Elsevier's Scopus and and
    Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) for the years 2001-2010. The UCSD map
    of science assigns the 25,000 journals to 554 subdisciplines that are further
    aggregated into 13 main disciplines of science. In the map, each discipline
    has a distinct color (green for 'Biology', brown for 'Earth Sciences', etc.)
    and a label. (Sub)disciplines that are similar closer to one another on the
    map. (Sub)disciplines that are especially similar are connected by grey lines.
